<h1>Bio</h1>
<font size=5>Yuanyuan Li, Ph.D., has joined the Biostatistics and Computational 
    Biology Branch (BCBB) at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, 
    National Institutes of Health in May 2011 as a postdoctorial 
    IRTA (Intramural Research Training Award) fellow and is currently 
    a research fellow under the supervision of Dr. Leping Li, senior Principal Investigator. 
    Her primary research interest lies in computational genomics 
    especially cancer genomics. 
<p>
    She obtained her Ph.D. degree from the Electrical Engineering and
    Computer Science (EECS) department at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in May 2010.
    Her research interests from artificial intelligence area include,
    probabilistic suffix trees (PST/PSA), KD-trees, classification and regression trees (CART), 
    and gradient boosting machines (GBM).

## Research projects
1. Pan-cancer analysis using TCGA RNA-seq data
    * Identified differential expressed genes that can predict 33 tumor types using GA/KNN multi-class classification.
    * The problem is challenging due to large data size (~20,000 genes x ~10,000 samples for 33 tumor types). 
    * It took ~ 1 month for GA/KNN to fully explore the solution space. 
    * Started exploring Gradient Boosted Machines (GBMs) as an alternative machine learning method for this problem. 
    * It only took GBMs a few hours to explore the solution space with higher classification accuracies.
    * Performed cluster analysis using signature genes.
    * Performed survival analysis (Cox regression model) using signature genes for all tumor types.
